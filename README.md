  A turn-based simulation of a world where each organism has its own way of acting. The user can choose different board sizes and control the flow of simulation. Since field can be occupied only one organism at time, organisms may get moved or even die. During each turn, all organisms perform their action in order based on their initiative and the results of their actions are based on individual strength. Some of them will move, grow, breed or even fight with others. Before each turn, player can control direction of movement for one of the organisms.
